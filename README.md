# To Run Code
-----------------------------------------------------------

I have created scripts in the "package.json" to run the files

- in "package.json" you will find the scripts like below

   {                                                                                                                                                                         
     "start":"nodemon index.js"                                                                                                                                              
     "usecode": "nodemon ./useStocks/use.js",                                                                                                                                
     "gsecode": "nodemon ./gseStocks/gse.js",                                                                                                                                
     "gsewithprom":"nodemon ./gsewithpromise/gsewithpromiseall.js"                                                                                                           
   }

*  if you want to run any file , just go to terminal then check your pathname and 
   then type :- npm run followed by the Key value which is available in package.json.
   - the key value which is responsible for the files


##                npm run start 
* For exapmle, if you want to run index.js file then go with the "npm run start" command


##                npm run usecode 
* if you want to run use.js file then go with the "npm run usecode" command


##                 npm run gsecode 
* if you want to run gse.js file then go with the "npm run gsecode" command


##               npm run gsewithprom
* if you want to run gsewithpromiseall.js file then go with the "npm run gsewithprom" command
