# To Run Code
-----------------------------------------------------------

I have created scripts in the "package.json" to run the files

- in "package.json" you will find the scripts like below

   {
     "start":"nodemon index.js",
     "usecode": "nodemon ./useStocks/use.js",
     "gsecode": "nodemon ./gseStocks/gse.js",
     "gsewithprom":"nodemon ./gsewithpromise/gsewithpromiseall.js"
   }

*  if you want to run any file , just go to terminal then check your pathname and 
   then type :- npm run followed by the Key value which is available in package.json.
   - the key value which is responsible for the files

* For exapmle, if you want to run index.js file then go with the below command
#                 npm run start 

* if you want to run use.js file then go with the below command
#                 npm run usecode 

* if you want to run gse.js file then go with the below command
#                 npm run gsecode 

* if you want to run gsewithpromiseall.js file then go with the below command
#                 npm run gsewithprom
